# PoEM
Proof of Existence Manager

This repository is a wraper for OpenTimestamps. https://github.com/opentimestamps/javascript-opentimestamps
The idea is basically to provide a service that generates proofs and persists .ots files in a KV database.
PoEM should also automatically check for upodates in .ots in pending-attesteation state.
